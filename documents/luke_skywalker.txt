Creation and development
Star Wars(1977)
George Lucas considered various characterizations for the protagonist ofthe originalStar Warsfilm.[d]The possibilities included a 60-year-old grizzled war hero, a Jedi Master, a dwarf, and a woman.[3][4]Luke's original surname was "Starkiller", and it remained in the script until a few months into filming. It was dropped due to what Lucas called "unpleasant connotations" withCharles Manson, who became a "star killer" in 1969 when he murdered the well-known actress Sharon Tate.[5][6]Lucas replaced the problematic name "Starkiller" with "Skywalker".[7]
Return of the Jedi(1983)
An alternate ending to the film reportedly featured Luke disappearing into the wilderness "likeClint Eastwoodin thespaghetti Westerns."[8]
The Force Awakens(2015)
Luke's lack of screen time inThe Force Awakenswas due to concerns by screenwriterMichael Arndtthat his presence would distract from Rey, leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become aplot device.[9][10]Hamill attended meetings for script readings, and helped conceal Luke's role in the film; instead of dialogue, he read stage directions. According to director and co-writerJ. J. Abrams, this allowed Hamill to remain involved and his reading helped make a "better experience for everyone."[11]
Portrayal
Mark Hamill was originally cast as Luke forStar Wars(1977). Other actors who auditioned for the role includeRobby Benson,William Katt,Kurt Russell, andCharles Martin Smith.[12][13]Hamill portrays the character in all the films of the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy, and in the television seriesThe MandalorianandThe Book of Boba Fett. Aidan Barton plays Luke as an infant inRevenge of the Sith(2005), while Grant Feely portrays him as a ten-year-old child in the seriesObi-Wan Kenobi(2022).
Hamill was injured in a car accident in January 1977, fracturing his nose and cheekbone.[14]Lucas justified the slight change to Hamill's likeness this would impose upon the sequel film,The Empire Strikes Back(1980), by asserting that in the interim between the two films, Luke had been fighting for theRebel Alliance. It was speculated that the Wampa attack at the beginning ofThe Empire Strikes Backwas written in to explain his facial injuries, but Lucas specifically disputed this in the DVD commentary of the film.[15]
Hamill voices the character inThe Star Wars Holiday Special(1978), in radio dramas ofStar Wars(1981) andThe Empire Strikes Back(1983), and in the animated web seriesForces of Destiny(2017�2018). Joshua Fardon voices Luke in theReturn of the Jediradio drama. Luke also appears in video games, in which he is voiced by a variety of different actors.[a]

Sequel trilogy
The Force Awakens(2015)
In the first installment of the sequel trilogy,The Force Awakens(2015), the opening crawl reveals that Luke Skywalker had mysteriously vanished some time in the 30 years after the destruction of the secondDeath Star. Luke went into hiding after his nephew and apprentice, Ben Solo, turned to the dark side and becameKylo Ren, a warlord of the tyrannicalFirst Orderand its leader,Snoke. When Ren killed all of his fellow apprentices and ushered in the fall of theNew Republic, Luke felt responsible, and disappeared. At the end of the film, theResistance, led by Leia, manage to reconstruct a map, which traces the location of the temple from the Empire's archives to his location, and he is subsequently found on the planetAhch-Toby the young scavenger, Rey, who presents him with the lightsaber previously wielded by both Luke and his father.
The Last Jedi(2017)
InThe Last Jedi(2017), Luke throws the lightsaber away after Rey gives it to him. He then seals himself in his home, refusing to talk to Rey. However, when he sees Chewbacca without Han and that Rey came on theMillennium Falcon, he inquires about what has gone on with his family. Rey informs Luke about Solo's death at the hands of Kylo Ren and that the First Order has risen to rule the galaxy. Rey asks Luke to train her in the ways of the Force. Luke is initially reluctant to train Rey, telling her that it is time for the Jedi Order to end.
After some persuasion from R2-D2, however, Luke starts training Rey, but grows increasingly afraid of her power. Luke then tells Rey the history of the Jedi Order, how Darth Sidious rose to power and how the Jedi were partly responsible for his father's fall to the dark side. Luke also initially tells Rey that Ben was corrupted by Snoke, and destroyed the Jedi Temple he confronted his treasonous nephew. Ultimately, however, Luke tells Rey the truth: He had briefly considered killing the sleeping Ben after seeing a vision of the destruction he could cause, but immediately relented; Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn and turned to the dark side because he felt betrayed. Upon learning this, Rey urges Luke to help her redeem Ben, but he refuses to participate in this nor help the Resistance. When Rey leaves, an embittered Luke tries to burn the Jedi temple, but fails. He is then visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures Luke that he still has a purpose.
Luke appears on the planetCrait, as the Resistance are staging a standoff against the First Order, and he apologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side. Luke steps in front of the First Order walkers, and unexpectedly survives an onslaught of blaster fire ordered by Ren. Ren charges at Luke in hand-to-hand combat, seemingly bisecting him with his lightsaber, but Luke remains unscathed; still on Ahch-To, Luke has sent a projection of himself to Crait, using the Force. This distraction allows the Resistance to escape the planet. Luke tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi before his projection disappears. On Ahch-To, Luke collapses then looks off in the horizon to see the planet's two suns setting before he becomes one with the Force and vanishes.
The Rise of Skywalker(2019)
Luke appears briefly inThe Rise of Skywalker, the ninth and final chapter of the main series.[22]When Rey discovers her lineage as the resurrected Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter, she exiles herself on Ahch-To, just as Luke had. Meaning to isolate herself, she throws Luke's lightsaber towards the burning wreckage of Ren's TIE whisper, in which she had traveled to her new home. Luke appears as a Force spirit, and reprimands Rey for treating the lightsaber with disrespect. Luke then admits that he was wrong not to participate in the Resistance, and thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself. Luke convinces Rey to not view herself as a Palpatine, but as the good person Leia saw her as when training her, and not to give up on her battle against the Sith. Luke lends Rey his old T-65B X-wingRed Fiveand tells Rey to combine his father's lightsaber with Leia's in her battle on Exegol. He also restrengthened Rey when she reached out to and heard the voices of the past Jedi to help her destroy Palpatine once and for all.
After Rey vanquishes Palpatine once and for all, she visits the moisture farm on Tatooine where Luke was raised. She buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers, revealing that she has constructed her own. A local asks Rey who she is. As Leia, who died earlier, and Luke appear as Force spirits, Rey names herself Rey Skywalker.

In the novelThe Courtship of Princess Leia, set four years after the Battle of Endor, Luke travels to the planetDathomir. There, he discovers a group of Force-sensitive witches called theWitches of Dathomir, banded into two separate groups: a collective of benign, matriarchal clans; the one he is in contact with being theSinging Mountain Clan, and the witches who have turned to the dark side, called theNightsisters. Discovering aprophecyin which it was told a Jedi would change the way of life on the land, Luke eventually realizes truly what the Force is for the first time in his life. While there, he destroys most of the Nightsisters (including their powerful leader, Gethzirion, and the galaxy's most powerful remaining warlord, Warlord Zsinj). Thanks to the help of the prophecy and witches, Luke recovers old Jedi records left by Yoda about 400 years prior. He decides to start a newJedi Academy, something he has been trying to do for six months before the start of the novel by finding old Jedi records and archives.[37]
In theThrawntrilogy, Luke meets formerEmperor's HandMara Jade, who is bound by Palpatine's disembodied voice that repeatedly commands "You will kill Luke Skywalker". Mara Jade is working with her boss, a fringe-of-the-galaxy smuggler namedTalon Karrde, who also plays a crucial role in this era. Although she was ready to fulfill that order to stop the voice, circumstances force her to keep him alive long enough to have him help escape a mutual danger. Despite her threats, Luke learns of the spell Mara is under and vows to free her from it. Meanwhile, the rest of theNew Republicis fighting againstGrand Admiral Thrawn, and thanks to Leia's help, he is eventually defeated, although several times Luke had to avoid getting captured by Thrawn or seduced by his ally,Joruus C'baoth. Eventually, he and Jade fight against Luke's clone, Luuke Skywalker, C'baoth's creation. During the fight, Mara Jade destroys the clone and, with Leia's help, destroys C'baoth. This entire time, C'baoth has been obsessed with "molding" Luke and Mara to serve him, perhaps due to the fact that the Spaarti cloning cylinders he was made from have a reputation of turning people insane later in life. Nonetheless, C'baoth is defeated by Mara along with Luuke, and Mara's acts silences her curse and completes her reconciliation with the Jedi, whom she later joins.[38]
In theJedi Academytrilogy, Luke resigns his commission in the New Republic's starfighter corps to pursue his Jedi studies and rebuild the Jedi Order in theMassassi TempleonYavin 4, a decision some anti-Jedi politicians use against him. Luke becomes the New Jedi Order's leader. His students in the ways of the Force include; Gantoris, Kam Solusar, Tionne, Streen, Cilghal, Kirana Ti and others. He is forced to contend with the spirit of ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun, who lures one of his most powerful students, Kyp Durron, to the dark side.
In theHand of Thrawn Duology, Luke, now a Jedi Master, works again with Mara Jade, who has learned to better her Force knowledge since her training at Luke's Jedi Academy. He falls in love with her and they eventually marry. Later, inEdge of Victory: Rebirth, they have a son whom they nameBen, after Obi-Wan Kenobi's pseudonym.
In theNew Jedi Orderseries, Luke creates a NewJedi Council. He idealises a new conclave, made up of Jedi, politicians and military officers. InForce Heretic: Remnant, he spearheads the mission into the Unknown Regions during theYuuzhan Vonginvasion to find the mysterious planet ofZonama Sekot, a planet that creates living starships. After the invasion is defeated with the help of the newMandalorianWarriors, a Sekotian fleet and a Galactic Alliance-Imperial Remnant fleet, Luke leads the New Jedi Order on Denon, the temporary capital of the Galactic Alliance and the site of the newly rebuiltJedi TempleonCoruscant. InThe Swarm War, the New Jedi Order moves to Ossus, the site of Jedi temples and libraries that were mostly destroyed 4,000 years prior. Upon the Killik's invasion of Chiss space and the transformation of most of the Myrkr mission survivors into Killik Joiners, Luke determines that the Killik's collective mind is being unconsciously controlled by a hive called the Dark Nest. The Dark Nest is controlled by a former Nightsister namedLomi Plo, who became their Unseen Queen with her ability to become invisible by exploiting the doubts of inferiors.
One of the Myrkr mission survivors, Alema Rar, attempts to plant seeds of doubt in Luke's mind by suggesting that his wife, Mara, may be somehow responsible for the death of his mother, Padm� Amidala, which he almost believes because of Mara's previous role as the Emperor's Hand. This allows Lomi to escape from Luke, who discovers recordings of his father Force-choking his mother onMustafar, his own birth, and his mother's death hidden inside R2-D2's memory drive. Because of this, he is able to overcome his doubts about Mara and defeat Lomi Plo in the final battle of the Swarm War, cutting her into four pieces.
Luke creates a New Jedi Council, and becomes the Grand Master of the New Jedi Order. He tells the Jedi to either follow his leadership, make the order their priority, or leave. Luke is also forced to exile the Padawans Tahiri,Lowbacca, and Tesar Sebatayne to Dagobah for divulging secret information to people outside the order.
In theLegacy of the Forceseries, Luke begins having visions of a figure cloaked in darkness destroying the galaxy and the Jedi. Luke is troubled that he has been unable to discern the identity of this figure, who seems to be much like Darth Vader. Complicating matters even more is the recent schism that has developed between Luke and his nephew,Jacen Solo. Already a tremendously powerful Jedi Knight, Jacen has begun adopting radical interpretations of the Force, causing a dramatic change in his personality. Luke fears that Jacen is pursuing the same path that ultimately led to Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side.
InBloodlines, the situation worsens when Luke's son,Ben, becomes Jacen's apprentice. Luke must also battle his wife, who refuses to confront Jacen for fear of alienating Ben. InTempest, Luke determines that the dark figure from his dreams isLumiya, a former Emperor's Hand now known as the "Dark Lady of the Sith". When Mara is murdered inSacrifice, Lumiya deceives Luke into believing that she killed her. They battle again, and Luke saves a weaponless Lumiya from falling to her death simply so that he can kill her himself. Luke returns to Coruscant where he is found by Ben, standing guard over Mara's body; upon speaking with his son, he realizes that Lumiya could not have killed her. Later in his private cabin, Luke breaks down over the death of his wife, knowing that her murderer is still at large. He does not realize that the killer is his own nephew, Jacen, who has now taken theSith nameDarth Caedus. InRevelation, Ben proves that Jacen killed Mara, but Luke is now reluctant to kill Jacen out of fear that he or his son will fall to the dark side in the process. The decision is taken out of his hands inInvincible, when Jaina kills Jacen in a final lightsaber duel.
InFate of the Jedinovels, set about 40 years after the first film, Luke Skywalker, now in his early sixties, is deposed by the government from his position as Grand Master, and exiled from Coruscant. However, if he finds the reason of why Jacen Solo fell to the dark side, he can be allowed to return. Ben insists on coming with him. Together, father and son explore dangerous and little-known portions of the galaxy. Luke and Ben learn much about each other, about the Force, and about the great dangers threatening the Jedi. The great love the two surviving Skywalkers have for each other grows even greater as they repeatedly save each other's lives and explore the limits and powers and mysteries of the Force.
